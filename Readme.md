Name: RGB encoder - To code or not to cde

Description: Competitors are given a picture that looks like static. In the RGB of the pixels, there is a hidden message that they must decode.

Solution: Competitors need to make a script that takes the RGB values of each pixel and associates the decimal value to an ASCII character. The red value of a single pixel is one character, the green value another character, and the blue value a third character. The image translates to Shakespear's Hamlet play. The competitors then need to find the only mention of a key in the script. Laerte's reply has been changed from "farwell" to the key.
